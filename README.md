Did it for my son. It's my first Arduino project. I know the code and all could be better. I don't have time to assist anyone, so please forgive me. This is the best I can do - share the files. DaveNaves.com was a great resource.

Used an Arduino Mega 2560, Ethernet shield, L289N motoe driver, 20x4 LCD, and 120v relays.

Good luck! Please share!
